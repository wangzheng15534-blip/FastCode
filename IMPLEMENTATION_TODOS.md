# FastCode Status Tracker

This file is the maintained source of truth for implementation status.
The ad hoc audit report was removed on May 3, 2026.

## Current state

The core architecture now works as a three-layer pipeline:

1. `plain_ast_embedding`
   - upstream-style tree-sitter structure + embeddings
2. `unified_ir_scip_merge`
   - canonical IR plus SCIP merge and persisted SCIP lineage
3. `language_specific_semantic_upgrade`
   - helper-backed or graph-backed resolver upgrades

The pipeline now exposes explicit layer status, metrics, warnings, and non-silent fallback behavior.

## Release readiness verdict

FastCode is currently in a hardened pre-release state, not a real stable release.

The core algorithmic path is much stronger than the original prototype: snapshot indexing, IR/SCIP merge, semantic resolver fallback, query-time escalation, artifact isolation, and async endpoint offloading all have regression coverage and green smoke gates.

The remaining gap to a stable release is no longer mainly "does the core pipeline work?" The gap is production evidence and operational hardening:
- true incremental source/index/update caching at the pipeline core
- true embedding/model cache reuse keyed by content and model fingerprint
- strict FP/FCIS dataflow enforcement across API -> schema -> core -> store boundaries
- completion of typed store/query/projection records so persistence and API shells stop leaking raw dict payloads
- install/package reproducibility from a clean environment
- real external-tool integration evidence across supported languages
- real PostgreSQL/backend semantics beyond local fakes
- API/file-upload security hardening
- service-wide state isolation under concurrent load/query/mutation traffic
- release documentation, compatibility policy, and deployment runbooks

Stable release should mean all of the following are true at once:
- core indexing/query paths are incrementally efficient, not only correct
- cache reuse is deterministic and invalidates on schema/model/tool changes
- package/import boundaries preserve a thin shell around a test-heavy functional core
- storage backends, migrations, and artifact compatibility are tested against real upgrade scenarios
- install, deploy, operate, and recover workflows are documented and reproducible
- release claims about language support, backend support, and compatibility are narrower than the proven evidence, not broader

## Landed hardening

- Resolver contract expanded with:
  - `ResolverSpec`
  - `SemanticCapability`
  - `ToolDiagnostic`
  - `ResolutionPatch`
- Registered resolver coverage for:
  - Python
  - JavaScript / TypeScript

  - C / C++
  - Zig
  - Fortran
  - Julia
- Added graph-backed fallback resolvers for non-C-family languages.
- Added helper-backed upgrade infrastructure and packaged helper assets into builds.
- Helper-backed resolvers now:
  - degrade to structural fallback on helper failure
  - preserve explicit diagnostics and helper failure stats
  - honor the indexed repository root instead of shell `cwd`
- Multi-language SCIP lineage now persists all artifact refs instead of collapsing to one row.
- Experimental SCIP languages are now explicit:

  - `pipeline_layers`
  - `pipeline_metrics`
  - SCIP artifact lineage metadata
- Query-time semantic escalation now exists for snapshot-scoped path/impact-style queries.
- Store boundary typing improved with frozen records for:
  - `ManifestRecord`

- Core helper semantic fidelity improved:
  - TypeScript helper emits inheritance facts
  - Go helper emits embedded-relationship inheritance facts
  - Java helper emits `extends` / `implements` inheritance facts
- Context-aware C/C++ header classification now upgrades ambiguous `.h` files:
  - parser-time language detection uses C++ content markers and sibling-source layout
  - C/C++ resolver dispatch applies the same heuristics during snapshot-scoped upgrades
- Store-boundary typing hardened:
  - `SnapshotRecord` frozen dataclass with `to_dict()`/`from_dict()`
  - `get_snapshot_record()` and `save_snapshot()` return typed records instead of raw dicts
  - All call sites migrated from bracket access to attribute access
  - `store.records` now also defines typed `SCIPArtifactRecord`, `RedoTaskRecord`, and `OutboxEventRecord` boundaries for active snapshot-store queue/artifact flows
  - `store.records` now also defines typed `ProjectionBuildRecord` and `ProjectionDirtyScopeRecord` boundaries for active projection-store lookup/dirty-scope flows
- Snapshot query concurrency safety:
  - `query_snapshot` serializes load+query with a `threading.Lock`
  - Thread-barrier regression tests (2 and 3 concurrent callers) verify artifact isolation
- Query/agency hardening:
  - agency-mode `query()` and `query_stream()` preserve cheap detected intent
  - iterative-agent standard retrieval applies caller filters after rerank
  - regression test proves semantic escalation can enable real IR graph expansion, not just a mocked second retrieval
- Incremental prefilter hardening:
  - `IndexPipeline._plan_incremental_elements()` reuses unchanged element metadata from the previous artifact manifest
  - compatible snapshots call `CodeIndexer.index_files()` only for added/modified files instead of falling back to full `extract_elements()`
  - integration coverage proves unchanged files bypass full extraction when compatibility checks match
- Embedding cache hardening:
  - `CodeEmbedder` now uses cache-aware batch embedding in the active indexing path
  - identical embedding texts are deduplicated before provider calls
  - cache keys are model-aware across provider/model/dimension/normalization/sequence-length settings
  - embedding cache payloads now store `float32` byte buffers plus explicit shape/dtype metadata instead of Python `list[float]` vectors
  - `store/cache.py` now persists hot dialogue/session/query payloads as explicit JSON envelopes and embedding entries as buffer-aware cache envelopes instead of generic object storage on the active cache paths
  - PostgreSQL retrieval persistence now strips raw embedding arrays from JSON metadata and stores vectors only in vector-specific columns
  - `store/pg_retrieval.py` now builds JSON row payloads from an explicit stable element field set instead of recursively normalizing arbitrary whole-element dicts during hot inserts
- Publishing boundary hardening:
  - Terminus lineage publishing now has a typed `IRSnapshot` boundary that builds payloads from snapshot fields and IR units/relations without full `IRSnapshot.to_dict()` expansion
  - `PublishingService` and the active index pipeline call the typed lineage publisher; the dict-based publisher API remains as a compatibility shim
- API shell serialization hardening:
  - REST and web query/session endpoints now use explicit source and dialogue serializers from `api/serialization.py` instead of generic recursive `safe_jsonable()` conversion
- Manifest/index-run boundary hardening:
  - `store/manifest.py` now reconstructs and serializes manifest payloads through explicit field mappings instead of `row_to_dict() -> ManifestRecord.from_dict()/to_dict()` round-trips on hot paths
  - `store/index_run.py` now materializes run/publish-task payloads through explicit row field extraction, and claimed publish tasks return the post-claim `running`/incremented-attempt state
  - `store/index_run.py` now also exposes typed `IndexRunRecord` / `PublishTaskRecord` accessors, and active publishing/indexing callers prefer those record APIs instead of dict payloads
- Unit-artifact boundary hardening:
  - `store/unit_artifacts.py` now reconstructs listed unit payloads through explicit row field extraction instead of `row_to_dict()`, and metadata JSON serialization is bounded to the metadata subtree with opaque values falling back to stable `repr(...)` strings
- Snapshot-record boundary hardening:
  - `store/snapshot.py` now reconstructs snapshot and snapshot-ref records through explicit row field extraction and uses explicit compatibility serializers for `find_by_*` / `resolve_snapshot_for_ref` dict-return helpers instead of `row_to_dict() -> from_dict()/to_dict()` round-trips on those active paths
  - `store/snapshot.py` now owns explicit snapshot-file serializers/deserializers for `save_snapshot()` / `load_snapshot()` instead of delegating the persistence boundary to `IRSnapshot.to_dict()` / `IRSnapshot.from_dict()`
  - active SCIP artifact read/write paths now use explicit typed artifact records instead of `SCIPArtifactRef.to_dict()` and `row_to_dict()` round-trips, and lineage metadata JSON serialization is bounded to the metadata subtree with opaque values falling back to stable `repr(...)` strings
  - redo-task and publish-outbox claim/failure paths now use explicit typed row extraction, and claimed payloads return the post-claim `running` / `in_progress` state with current timestamps and counters
- Projection boundary hardening:
  - `store/projection.py` now reconstructs dirty-scope and build payloads through explicit typed row adapters and explicit compatibility serializers instead of tuple-shaped row unpacking directly into ad hoc dict payloads
  - `indexing/projection.py` now hashes scope parameters and materializes built projection payloads through explicit field serializers instead of `ProjectionScope.to_dict()` / `ProjectionBuildResult.to_dict()`
- Cache boundary hardening:
  - `store/cache.py` now persists dialogue turns and session indexes through typed `DialogueTurnRecord` / `DialogueSessionRecord` payload serializers and exposes typed record accessors alongside compatibility dict-return helpers
  - active query/session callers now prefer typed cache session records where they only need turn counts or `multi_turn` flags
- Indexer boundary hardening:
  - `indexing/indexer.py` now serializes import payloads explicitly and reuses the serialized import list for file hash/metadata derivation instead of repeated `ImportInfo.to_dict()` expansion
  - active extract/incremental embedding handoff now builds a minimal explicit element payload for the embedder instead of deep-copying full `CodeElement.to_dict()` payloads on the hot path
- Index pipeline boundary hardening:
  - `indexing/pipeline.py` now materializes vector-store and PG-upsert element payloads through explicit serializers on the active snapshot indexing path instead of `CodeElement.to_dict()` expansion plus in-place metadata mutation
- Retrieval boundary hardening:
  - `ir/element.py` now exposes explicit `serialize_code_element(...)` and `deserialize_code_element(...)` adapters so retrieval shells can materialize and rehydrate stable element payloads without recursive dataclass expansion or `CodeElement(**payload)` mass-assignment
  - `retrieval/hybrid.py` and `retrieval/core/fusion.py` now build keyword/file/type/graph-expansion/doc-projection result payloads and BM25 persistence payloads through explicit `CodeElement` serialization instead of repeated `CodeElement.to_dict()` calls on active paths
  - `retrieval/iterative.py` now serializes agent-selected class/function hits and file-level indexed lookups through explicit element payloads instead of `CodeElement.to_dict()` expansion on active agency-mode selection paths
  - `retrieval/hybrid.py` and `main/fastcode.py` now reload persisted BM25 element payloads through the explicit deserializer instead of `CodeElement(**payload)` expansion on active cache/load paths
- Legacy graph boundary hardening:
  - `graph/build.py` now persists compatibility graph element indices through explicit element serializers instead of `CodeElement.to_dict()` calls
  - `graph/build.py` now reloads and merges persisted graph element payloads through the explicit element deserializer instead of `CodeElement(**payload)` expansion, while preserving the existing duplicate-name recovery behavior via `element_by_id`
- Object materialization hardening:
  - PostgreSQL semantic fallback now keeps candidate vectors in NumPy arrays and only JSON-decodes metadata for ranked results returned across the Python boundary
  - repository overview persistence now writes an explicit JSON manifest plus NumPy embedding archive, lets metadata-only callers skip the embedding archive entirely, and only JSON-decodes ranked overview metadata for returned rows
  - PostgreSQL relational fact persistence uses explicit typed payload serializers instead of repeated record `to_dict()` expansion
- Async endpoint hardening:
  - REST API repository load/index/cache-load/multi-index/upload paths offload blocking work with `asyncio.to_thread`
  - web UI upload and upload+index paths offload ZIP extraction, repository load, and indexing
  - REST API and web UI delete/cache/refresh maintenance endpoints offload blocking mutations
- API upload/CORS hardening:
  - REST and web ZIP upload paths now validate archive members before extraction, rejecting traversal, absolute paths, symlinks/special files, oversized members, excessive file counts, and suspicious expansion ratios
  - repository ZIP loading in `RepositoryLoader` uses the same safe extraction helper instead of raw `ZipFile.extractall()`
  - CORS defaults are no longer wildcard; allowed origins and credentials are controlled by explicit environment settings
  - REST API and web examples now bind localhost by default, with public binding documented as an explicit trusted-operator decision
- Service singleton lock hardening:
  - `FastCode` now exposes a service-level reentrant state lock around repository load/index, snapshot pipeline, projection build, query/query-stream, multi-repo cache load, delete, cleanup, and shutdown flows
  - REST and web load+index/upload+index helpers now execute the combined mutation under one service critical section, preventing interleaving between repository replacement and indexing
  - Regression tests cover query serialization against load, index, delete, refresh, and cleanup/unload-style mutations
- Lock fencing hardening:
  - PostgreSQL same-owner lock refresh preserves the current fencing token instead of invalidating in-flight work
- Package-root import-boundary hardening:
  - `fastcode/__init__.py` no longer mutates process environment at import time
  - `fastcode/__init__.py` keeps compatibility re-exports lazy instead of importing shell-heavy modules eagerly
  - `fastcode.main.__init__` now exposes `FastCode` lazily so `import fastcode.main` does not load the composition root
  - internal API/MCP modules import `FastCode` from `fastcode.main.fastcode` instead of the root compatibility surface
  - architecture tests now enforce thin package roots and ban internal `from fastcode import ...` re-export usage

## Incremental Update and Cache Audit

**Audit date:** May 4, 2026

**Verdict:** partial PASS. FastCode now has real early reuse for unchanged files, but it does not yet implement graceful end-to-end incremental update for compiler/tool-backed stages.

**What is already true in code:**
- `fastcode.indexing.pipeline._plan_incremental_elements()` reuses unchanged element metadata from the previous artifact manifest and only reindexes added/modified files.
- `fastcode.tests.integration.test_snapshot_pipeline.test_pipeline_incremental_prefilter_only_indexes_changed_files` proves unchanged files bypass `extract_elements()` and only changed files are passed to `index_files()`.
- `fastcode.indexing.embedder.CodeEmbedder` uses cache-aware `embed_code_elements()`, deduplicates identical texts, and keys cache entries by provider/model/dimension/normalization/max-sequence-length identity.
- helper-backed semantic resolvers already scope helper input to changed `target_paths`, so helper work is narrower than full-repo in the happy path.

**What is not yet true:**
- the pipeline still rebuilds a full combined `elements` list and then rebuilds AST IR from that whole set, so reuse is earlier than before but not yet shard-native.
- optional SCIP still detects languages by walking the repository and then invokes repo-scoped indexers, so one-file edits can still pay near full compiler/indexer cost.
- the late `diff_changed_files()` / `apply_incremental_update()` path is not yet a sufficient primary correctness anchor because `build_ir_from_ast()` does not currently persist canonical `blob_oid` / `content_hash` on file units.
- helper-backed runtimes still pay per-run process startup cost; the Go helper currently uses `go run`, which also implies repeated compile/build overhead.

**Release implication:** current behavior materially reduces repeated parse and embedding work for unchanged files, but stable-release claims must still say compiler/tooling cost is only partially incremental.

## Architecture contract in force

The current release bar is aligned to the repo-template functional-core guidance:

1. Pydantic stops at the boundary:
   - `fastcode.schemas.api` owns request/response validation.
   - core packages (`ir`, `graph`, `retrieval`) stay Pydantic-free.
2. Persistence trusts typed records:
   - store/infrastructure code should return frozen dataclasses or typed records, not ad hoc dict payloads.
3. Translation stays explicit:
   - shell code maps field-by-field between API payloads, core dataclasses, and storage records.
   - no `**model_dump()`, `**__dict__`, or hidden mass-assignment at boundaries.
4. FCIS test split:
   - functional core gets the majority of regression effort.
   - imperative shell remains thin and covered mostly by boundary/integration tests.
5. Package roots stay thin:
   - Python always executes `fastcode/__init__.py` before importing any `fastcode.*` submodule.
   - root and subpackage `__init__.py` files must not perform runtime setup, environment mutation, or eager shell imports.
   - root re-exports are compatibility-only and lazy; internal modules import concrete domain/composition modules directly.

This contract is only partially complete today. The architecture tests now enforce parts of it, including package-root purity, but large store and shell surfaces are still dict-heavy.

## Stable Release Gap

### P0: Must Close Before Stable Release

These are release blockers. Do not tag a stable release while any P0 item is open.

### P0 Acceptance Bar

Every P0 item needs all three forms of closure:
- implementation: the code path exists and is wired into the default runtime path
- enforcement: tests, architecture checks, or release-gate automation fail when it regresses
- evidence: docs, metrics, or benchmark output show the stable-release claim is true in practice

### P0.1 Install and packaging reproducibility

**Gap:** Tests run in the repository checkout, but stable users install packages, optional extras, and helper assets from built artifacts.

**Required work:**
- Build and test both wheel and sdist from a clean checkout.
- Run import/CLI/API smoke tests from the installed wheel, not from editable source.
- Verify helper assets are included in built artifacts and executable from installed package paths.
- Define supported Python versions and run the release gate against each supported version.
- Split optional extras clearly: API server, PostgreSQL, SCIP/tooling, docs ingestion, dev/test.
- Pin or constrain high-risk runtime dependencies enough to avoid resolver drift.

**Exit criteria:**
- `pip install dist/*.whl` in a fresh virtualenv can run CLI, API import, helper path checks, and a tiny index/query smoke.
- Release docs list exact install commands for local-only and production/PostgreSQL modes.

### P0.1a Workspace and layout stability

**Gap:** The package split is now mostly landed, but stable release also requires the merged workspace to behave correctly from the repository root, not only when commands are run from `fastcode/`.

The template philosophy remains correct for Python: use one importable package with descriptive domain modules instead of pretending uv workspace members provide native import isolation. The stable-release risk is not the nested domain layout itself; it is accidental boundary collapse through package roots, eager re-exports, and imports that route pure modules through shell-heavy compatibility surfaces.

**Current state:**
- root `pytest` collection now honors workspace-level `testpaths`, recursion excludes, import paths, and marker registration
- stale renamed-module references were cleaned up in active tests and comments
- root smoke no longer collects `repo_backup/` or dies on import-file mismatch

**Remaining work:**
- remove or clean stale `__pycache__` trees left behind by the pre-merge layout so they stop polluting diagnostics
- keep root and package pytest policy in sync when markers or plugins change
- audit public docs/examples for pre-merge module paths
- keep architecture tests green for package-root purity whenever new public exports or subpackage `__init__.py` files are added

**Exit criteria:**
- `uv run pytest` from repository root is a supported release command
- workspace-level QA commands no longer depend on implicit `cd fastcode`

### P0.2 True incremental source/index caching

**Gap:** The current release path is partially incremental, not gracefully incremental end to end. The manifest-driven prefilter can skip unchanged-file parse and embedding, but later AST/IR materialization, whole-repo SCIP, and some helper/tool startup costs still scale close to a full reindex.

**Why this is core-level:** This is the largest remaining architecture gap between a hardened prototype and a stable release. On medium and large repos, “incremental” behavior still scales like full reindex.

**Current failure modes:**
- repository inventory and file hashing are recomputed repeatedly across snapshot identity, incremental planning, and SCIP language detection.
- `run_index_pipeline()` rehydrates unchanged metadata into one full `elements` list and rebuilds AST IR from the entire combined set instead of merging file-native IR shards.
- optional SCIP remains repo-scoped: `detect_scip_languages()` walks the repository and `run_scip_for_language()` invokes language indexers for the repo even when only one file changed.
- `diff_changed_files()` relies on canonical file-unit `blob_oid` / `content_hash`, but `build_ir_from_ast()` does not yet populate those identities end to end, so the late snapshot-diff merge cannot be the primary trusted planner.
- unchanged files are skipped before parse/embedding, but not yet before AST-IR rebuild, relational fact rebuild, IR graph rebuild, or most compiler/indexer work.

**Required work:**
- Promote the existing manifest-first prefilter into the canonical `plan_changes` stage:
  - inventory repository once
  - compute file fingerprints once
  - diff against prior snapshot before parse/embed/SCIP/helper execution
- Share one canonical inventory pass across:
  - repository identity
  - loader-visible files
  - incremental planner
  - SCIP language detection
- Make file fingerprints first-class and mandatory:
  - prefer git `blob_oid` when available
  - otherwise persist `content_hash`
  - fall back to size/mtime only as an explicit degraded mode
- Add a `FileArtifactStore` keyed by `(repo, rel_path, blob_oid/content_hash)` for:
  - parsed file output
  - file-level AST/IR shards
  - per-file semantic facts
  - per-file embedding payloads or embedding references
- Refactor the pipeline into:
  - `plan_changes`
  - `extract_changed`
  - `merge_snapshot`
  - `persist`
- Promote existing `CodeIndexer.index_files()` and file-manifest logic into the snapshot pipeline instead of keeping them as side paths.
- Reuse unchanged per-file artifacts before embedding and before SCIP where supported.
- Split compiler/tooling invalidation by scope:
  - file-local helper execution when exported interface is unchanged
  - dependent-neighborhood rebuild when exported interface changes
  - package/workspace or repo-wide rebuild when toolchain/build graph changes
- Remove avoidable repeated tool startup:
  - replace `go run` helper execution with packaged binaries, cached build artifacts, or daemonized helper mode
- Treat “missing file fingerprints” as a reason to disable incremental mode, not to silently claim success.

**Exit criteria:**
- A one-file edit does not trigger full-repo parsing or full-repo embedding.
- A one-file implementation-only edit does not trigger whole-repo SCIP/helper recomputation unless interface or build-graph rules require widening.
- Incremental publish reports correct `added/modified/removed/unchanged` counts for both git and non-git repos.
- There is an integration test proving unchanged files are not reparsed or re-embedded.
- There is a benchmark/regression test showing one-file update cost is materially below full reindex.

### P0.2a Graceful update under code change

**Research framing:** A graceful updater should widen work in proportion to semantic impact, not in proportion to raw textual churn.

**Core idea:** Separate change detection into four classes and bind each class to an invalidation radius:
- identity-stable: no rebuild
- implementation-local: changed file body, stable exported interface
- interface-affecting: changed exports, signatures, inheritance, imports, or generated symbol set
- toolchain/global: changed build config, dependency lockfile, generator output, parser fingerprint, or model/tool fingerprint

**Recommended update calculus:**
1. inventory once:
   - collect `blob_oid` or `content_hash`
   - language
   - package/workspace membership
   - toolchain slice (`go.mod`, `package.json`, `tsconfig`, `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.)
2. derive two digests per file:
   - content digest for exact file identity
   - interface digest for exported semantic surface
3. choose invalidation radius:
   - content changed, interface stable:
     - reparse changed file
     - recompute embeddings only for changed file elements
     - rerun file-local semantic helper
     - preserve reverse dependencies
   - interface changed:
     - invalidate reverse imports/callers/inheritors reachable from the changed file
     - rerun affected helper/SCIP/package slices
   - toolchain/global changed:
     - widen to package, workspace, or full repository explicitly
4. store file-native artifacts:
   - `ParseShard`
   - `IRShard`
   - `EmbeddingShard`
   - `SemanticFactShard`
   - `InterfaceDigest`
   - dependency frontier metadata
5. publish atomically:
   - stage a new snapshot
   - merge unchanged shards plus recomputed shards
   - promote only after validation succeeds

**Graceful degradation rules:**
- Missing or inconsistent fingerprints must widen scope, never narrow it.
- Helper/SCIP/tool failure must downgrade semantic precision with warnings, not silently preserve stale changed-file facts.
- Unknown dependency frontier must invalidate the larger safe neighborhood.
- A degraded incremental publish should carry explicit metadata about which reuse assumptions were disabled.

**Evidence requirements:**
- A function-body edit stays file-local.
- A signature or inheritance change invalidates dependents but not unrelated subtrees.
- A build-config change widens scope deterministically.
- Benchmarks are reported by edit class, not only by “full vs incremental”.

### P0.3 Embedding/model cache correctness and reuse

**Gap:** There is now a real text-level embedding cache in the active indexing path, but its correctness envelope is still narrower than a stable release requires.

**Why this is core-level:** Stable release users will judge the system by repeated indexing/update cost. Without a correct embedding cache, model inference dominates runtime and cost even when source changes are small.

**Current failure modes:**
- embedding cache identity is still mostly local to `CodeEmbedder`; snapshot metadata, vector artifacts, repo-overview artifacts, and PG/vector persistence do not yet share one first-class embedding fingerprint contract.
- the preparation schema is implicit in `_prepare_code_text()` and only manually versioned through optional `cache_version`, so schema drift still depends on operator discipline.
- the incremental manifest compatibility hash checks major embedding settings, but the same fingerprint discipline is not yet propagated uniformly across all reuse surfaces.
- Ollama embedding path is effectively serial, ignoring batch-level reuse opportunities.
- model startup is eager, so read-only operations can pay unnecessary model initialization overhead.

**Required work:**
- Formalize the current embedder path behind an `EmbeddingService` or equivalent core boundary with:
  - `prepare_text(element)`
  - `fingerprint()`
  - `embed_many(texts)`
  - cache-aware `embed_elements(elements, reuse_index)`
- Define and persist an `embedding_fingerprint` including:
  - provider
  - model name/version identity
  - normalization flag
  - max sequence length
  - embedding text preparation schema version
  - embedding dimension
- Key embedding cache entries by:
  - prepared text hash
  - embedding fingerprint
- Store fingerprint on:
  - snapshot metadata
  - vector-store artifacts
  - repo overviews
  - query/embedding cache keys
  - any PG/vector persistence rows that serve embeddings
- Refuse artifact reuse or force rebuild when embedding fingerprint mismatches.
- Batch cache hits/misses correctly: fetch cached vectors first, embed only misses, then write misses.
- Make embedder/model initialization lazy for non-embedding code paths.
- Remove avoidable quadratic work in batch embedding assignment.

**Exit criteria:**
- Repeated indexing of unchanged files makes zero provider/model calls.
- Switching embedding model or preparation schema invalidates old vectors deterministically.
- There is a test proving two identical embedding texts trigger one provider computation.
- There is a test proving same-dimension model changes do not silently reuse stale vectors.

### P0.4 Snapshot artifact handle caching for query serving

**Gap:** Snapshot artifacts are cached only as disk bundles. Query-time loads still mutate global singleton state and serialize all snapshot queries through one critical section.

**Required work:**
- Introduce immutable `LoadedSnapshotArtifacts` handles.
- Add in-process LRU caching by `artifact_key`.
- Make query paths consume request-local handles instead of swapping singleton `vector_store` / `retriever` / `graph_builder` state.
- Separate serving-time artifact load from repair/rebuild behavior.

**Exit criteria:**
- Repeated queries against the same snapshot avoid disk reload.
- Concurrent snapshot queries on different snapshots do not cross-contaminate results.
- Eviction behavior is bounded and tested.

### P0.5 Real external-tool integration matrix

**Gap:** Resolver and SCIP contracts are represented in metadata and unit tests, but several languages still rely on helper heuristics or experimental tooling. Stable release claims must match real command behavior.

**Required work:**
- Add availability-gated integration tests for actual SCIP/indexer commands where supported.
- Verify command contracts for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Go, Rust, C#, C, and C++.
- Keep Zig, Fortran, and Julia explicitly experimental unless real command contracts are validated in CI-like environments.
- Persist and test multi-language experimental warning strings and warning metadata.
- Document exact system dependencies per language.

**Exit criteria:**
- Stable language list has real command smoke coverage or is downgraded in docs to structural/experimental support.
- Experimental languages never appear as stable in API metadata, docs, or release notes.

### P0.6 Production storage semantics

**Gap:** SQLite local mode is well covered, and Postgres-oriented code exists, but stable production semantics require real backend tests for locks, migrations, outbox, redo, and relational fact persistence.

**Required work:**
- Run a real PostgreSQL integration suite for snapshot save/load, manifests, locks, fencing, staging, outbox, redo tasks, SCIP refs, and graph facts.
- Verify migration/idempotency behavior on an existing database, not only fresh schema creation.
- Document SQLite as local/single-process only where lock/fact APIs are no-ops.
- Add stale-lock and ownership tests against real PostgreSQL transactions.
- Add backup/restore and schema version compatibility notes.

**Exit criteria:**
- Postgres integration tests are part of the release gate or explicitly required before tagging.
- SQLite limitations are documented in user-facing release docs.

### P0.6a FP/FCIS data schema flow completion

**Gap:** The codebase now has the right package layout for `api`, `schemas`, `retrieval`, `store`, and `main`, but the dataflow contract is still inconsistent. Core paths use frozen dataclasses in several places, while other store/query/projection flows still pass raw `dict[str, Any]` payloads across boundaries.

**Why this is release-critical:** Stable release needs predictable schema flow:
- API shell validates with Pydantic
- core logic operates on explicit frozen types
- persistence returns typed records
- translation between these layers is explicit and testable

Without that, layout cleanup is cosmetic; runtime contracts remain implicit.

**Current gaps visible in code:**
- `store/manifest.py` and `store/snapshot.py` still expose mixed record/dict APIs instead of converging on typed records
- `store/projection.py`, `store/cache.py`, `store/vector.py`, and `store/pg_retrieval.py` remain heavily dict-oriented at public compatibility boundaries even where active row materialization is now typed
- query/retrieval paths still use dict-shaped rows as a primary interchange format instead of a small typed boundary model set
- `schemas/__init__.py` and `schemas/api.py` correctly isolate Pydantic, but the rest of the system has not fully converged on explicit translation adapters

**Required work:**
- define the canonical schema flow explicitly in code/docs:
  - `schemas.api` / `schemas.config` for Pydantic boundary types
  - `schemas.core_types` and `store.records` for frozen dataclass interchange
  - adapters that translate field-by-field between boundary, core, and persistence forms
- eliminate mixed dict/record public APIs where possible:
  - promote typed snapshot artifact/redo/outbox records into public `*_record()` accessors where those surfaces are stable
  - add typed projection/build/session/cache metadata records where those payloads are stable enough
- make store modules prefer `*_record()` style APIs and treat dict-returning helpers as compatibility shims
- keep retrieval-core purity strict:
  - no Pydantic imports
  - no hidden boundary serialization logic in pure ranking/fusion/graph functions
- add architecture fitness tests that assert:
  - shell packages do not mass-assign Pydantic payloads into core/store records
  - store modules do not regress from typed records back to dict returns in stabilized surfaces
  - imports continue to point inward after the package split

**Exit criteria:**
- a maintainer can trace request data as:
  - `api schema -> explicit translator -> core dataclass -> explicit persistence record`
- the hot release paths no longer rely on undocumented dict shapes as their primary cross-layer contract
- architecture tests fail fast when new code bypasses explicit translation

### P0.6b Copy-boundary and serialization discipline

**Gap:** Boundary handling is still copy-heavy. Several hot paths materialize Python `dict`/`list` payloads repeatedly before persistence, cache storage, or native-library handoff. That undermines both throughput and the intended thin-shell contract.

**Current audit findings:**
- generic JSON normalization is now narrower, but still present in remaining shell/storage edges:
  - `utils/json.py:safe_jsonable()` recursively converts dict/list/set/object trees
  - `api/routes.py` and `api/web.py` now use explicit source/dialogue serializers, but other API payloads still pass through dict-shaped records
- store persistence still serializes JSON payloads at DB boundaries, but some hot rows now avoid full object expansion:
- `store/snapshot.py` relational facts now use explicit field serializers instead of `json.dumps(obj.to_dict())`
- `store/snapshot.py` snapshot/snapshot-ref lookup helpers now use explicit typed row reconstruction and explicit compatibility serializers on active lookup paths
- `store/snapshot.py` snapshot-file save/load paths now use store-owned explicit IR payload serializers instead of `IRSnapshot.to_dict()` / `IRSnapshot.from_dict()` round-trips, and non-`networkx` graph persistence now uses a narrow JSON walker instead of generic object normalization
- active `store/snapshot.py` SCIP artifact, redo-task, and publish-outbox paths now materialize rows through explicit typed record adapters instead of `row_to_dict()`
- `store/projection.py` now reconstructs active dirty-scope/build rows through typed record adapters and explicit compatibility serializers
- `store/index_run.py` now exposes typed run/publish-task records and active publishing/indexing callers prefer those record APIs, but compatibility dict-return helpers still remain
- `store/cache.py` now reconstructs active dialogue/session cache payloads through typed records and explicit compatibility serializers instead of mutating ad hoc dict payloads in place
- `store/pg_retrieval.py` now emits explicit typed element payloads for `metadata_json`, and `store/manifest.py` now uses explicit row-field serializers on active paths, but compatibility dict-return APIs still expose dict-shaped boundaries in places
- vector/cache paths copy embeddings through Python containers:
  - `indexing/embedder.py` now stores cached embeddings as native `float32` byte buffers
  - `store/cache.py` now writes typed dialogue/session/query payloads as explicit JSON envelopes and embedding payloads as length-prefixed buffer envelopes; generic `get()/set()` remains for legacy or untyped callers
  - `store/vector.py` now persists repository overview metadata as an explicit JSON manifest plus NumPy embedding archive and lets metadata-only overview callers avoid loading embedding payloads
  - `store/pg_retrieval.py` no longer duplicates embeddings into JSON metadata, but still materializes `list[float]`/vector-literal form at the PG vector boundary
  - `store/pg_retrieval.py` still receives fallback search vectors through DB row arrays, but ranks them as a NumPy matrix before metadata inflation
- unit artifact persistence is narrower, but still dict-shaped:
  - `store/unit_artifacts.py` no longer uses generic row normalization on list/load paths and now serializes only the metadata subtree explicitly
  - it still persists unit metadata as JSON text plus a dict-shaped compatibility payload for callers
- publishing/integration edges are partially hardened:
  - Terminus lineage publishing now accepts typed `IRSnapshot` objects and avoids full snapshot `to_dict()` expansion in `PublishingService` and the active index pipeline
  - `PublishingService` now also returns compatibility manifest payloads through an explicit field serializer instead of `manifest.to_dict()`
  - remaining copy points include JSON outbox payload strings and the legacy dict publisher API kept for compatibility
- indexing hot paths are narrower:
  - `indexing/indexer.py` now serializes imports explicitly and reuses the serialized import list for file-level hashes/metadata instead of repeated `ImportInfo.to_dict()` calls
  - active embedder handoff now passes a minimal explicit element payload instead of deep-copying full `CodeElement.to_dict()` payloads before embedding
  - `indexing/pipeline.py` now materializes unit-artifact refresh/replace rows through explicit `CodeElement`/mapping serializers instead of a generic `to_dict()` fallback, and it no longer mutates input metadata while enriching those rows
- snapshot indexing materialization is narrower:
  - `indexing/pipeline.py` now stages vector-store and PG retrieval payloads from explicit serialized element views instead of expanding each `CodeElement` with `to_dict()` and mutating live element metadata for transport-only fields
- retrieval result assembly is narrower:
  - `retrieval/hybrid.py` and `retrieval/core/fusion.py` now materialize result elements through explicit `serialize_code_element(...)` payloads instead of repeated `CodeElement.to_dict()` calls for keyword hits, file/type helpers, graph expansion, projected-only doc backfill, and BM25 persistence
  - `retrieval/iterative.py` now uses the same explicit serializer for agent-found file/class/function result rows instead of expanding full `CodeElement.to_dict()` payloads during selection-to-result conversion
  - persisted BM25 reload paths in `retrieval/hybrid.py` and `main/fastcode.py` now rehydrate `CodeElement` objects through an explicit adapter instead of `CodeElement(**payload)` mass-assignment
- graph artifact boundaries are narrower:
  - `graph/build.py` now writes compatibility graph element indices through explicit `serialize_code_element(...)` payloads and rehydrates persisted `element_by_name` / `element_by_id` entries through `deserialize_code_element(...)` on load/merge instead of `CodeElement.to_dict()` / `CodeElement(**payload)` round-trips

**Direction:** "Zero-copy" is only realistic where data remains in native buffers or immutable typed views end to end. In pure Python object graphs, the release target should be:
- zero extra copies across native/vector boundaries where possible
- one explicit materialization at the shell/storage boundary where JSON is actually required
- no repeated dict/list reconstruction between adjacent internal layers

**Required work:**
- Define boundary classes by transport type:
  - Python-core typed dataclasses for internal flow
  - native-buffer carriers for embeddings/vectors
  - JSON/bytes serializers only at persistence/API/native-process edges
- For embedding/vector paths:
  - keep embeddings as `np.ndarray[np.float32]` through compute, cache lookup, batch add, and DB/vector handoff
  - avoid `tolist()` except where the storage driver strictly requires JSON/array literals
  - prefer binary/native array transfer where backend supports it
- For JSON/document paths:
  - serialize once at the final boundary instead of `to_dict()` followed by recursive cleanup followed by `json.dumps()`
  - evaluate direct JSON emission in the native/storage layer when supported by the backend/driver
- For store/query shell:
  - replace generic `safe_jsonable()` usage on known typed payloads with explicit serializers
  - eliminate dict round-trips like `record -> dict -> row/json -> dict -> record` on hot paths
- Add architecture/perf tests that fail when:
  - embeddings are converted to Python lists in active hot paths without a backend requirement
  - boundary code performs repeated `to_dict()` / `safe_jsonable()` / `dict()` normalization on already-typed objects
  - cache/storage adapters regress from typed/buffer-aware APIs to generic pickle/dict payloads

**Exit criteria:**
- hot embedding/vector flows stay in native array form until the final backend boundary
- typed internal payloads are materialized to JSON at most once per boundary crossing
- a benchmark proves lower copy/allocation overhead for repeated index/update/query workloads

### P0.6c Object materialization minimization

**Gap:** Even where FastCode already uses native-backed libraries (`FAISS`, `NumPy`, `pgvector`), the runtime frequently materializes results back into Python `dict`, `list`, dataclass, or `networkx` object graphs too early. That destroys the benefit of keeping work in C/C++/Rust-backed layers.

**Current audit findings:**
- embedding path:
  - `indexing/embedder.py` now writes cached vectors as `float32` byte buffers and reconstructs cache hits with `np.frombuffer(...)`
  - stale pre-buffer list payloads are treated as cache misses and overwritten with the current binary format
  - `indexing/indexer.py` now hands the embedder a minimal explicit payload instead of materializing full `CodeElement.to_dict()` copies for every indexed element
- retrieval result path:
  - `retrieval/hybrid.py` and `retrieval/core/fusion.py` now defer `CodeElement` materialization to explicit final result serializers instead of expanding full dataclass payloads through `to_dict()` in keyword/graph/doc-projection helper paths
- PostgreSQL retrieval path:
  - `store/pg_retrieval.py` now strips raw embedding arrays from `metadata_json` before insert so vector payloads are not duplicated in JSON storage
  - it still converts embeddings to Python lists/vector literals for the current pgvector/array insert path
- vector retrieval path:
  - `store/vector.py` keeps FAISS native indexes, persists repository overviews as an explicit JSON manifest plus NumPy embedding archive, and vectorizes repository-overview ranking before result metadata assembly
  - full repository-overview consumers still decode JSON metadata into Python dicts because selector/BM25 flows currently operate on Python text/metadata payloads
- PostgreSQL retrieval result path:
  - semantic fallback now delays JSON metadata inflation until after vectorized NumPy ranking
  - direct pgvector/keyword result rows still materialize JSON payloads at the retrieval boundary
- graph path:
  - hot graph operations still use `networkx`, which is fundamentally Python-object heavy
  - graph persistence/load paths materialize large object graphs instead of keeping a compact native representation
- IR/store path:
  - `IRSnapshot.to_dict()/from_dict()` and record `to_dict()/from_dict()` patterns are still common interchange mechanisms
  - DB rows are routinely converted with `row_to_dict()` before typed reconstruction

**Design rule:** keep data in C/C++/Rust-backed representation as long as possible, and only materialize into Python objects when:
- Python business logic must inspect or mutate it
- an API boundary requires JSON/text output
- a backend driver lacks a native/binary transfer path

**Required work:**
- Introduce explicit "materialization boundaries" in architecture docs/code:
  - native buffer / native index boundary
  - typed Python domain boundary
  - JSON/text/API boundary
- For vectors/embeddings:
  - prefer ndarray/buffer-preserving cache payloads
  - avoid list-of-float round-trips for pgvector/FAISS handoff if binary/native driver support is available
  - keep batch search/rerank operations vectorized in NumPy/FAISS rather than re-looping through Python objects prematurely
- For graph processing:
  - migrate hot graph algorithms toward `igraph` or another compact native-backed engine
  - isolate Python object materialization to debug/export/API layers
- For store/DB paths:
  - move from `row -> dict -> typed record` toward `row -> typed record` adapters
  - avoid full JSON object inflation when only a few fields are needed
- For IR interchange:
  - stop using `to_dict()/from_dict()` as the default internal interchange format in hot paths
  - keep typed instances or compact columnar/native forms until a real boundary requires expansion
- Add measurement around:
  - Python allocation counts
  - peak RSS during index/query/update workloads
  - materialization cost share in profiling for medium repositories

**Exit criteria:**
- profiling shows hot paths spend most time in native/vector/graph backends, not Python object assembly
- repeated query/index/update workloads avoid unnecessary `list`/`dict`/JSON inflation in the inner loop
- architecture tests and profiling notes identify any intentional materialization boundary explicitly

### P0.7 API and file-upload security hardening

**Status:** Closed for the current trusted-local/proxy-auth contract. Direct unauthenticated production exposure remains explicitly unsupported.

**Recently landed:**
- Raw `ZipFile.extractall()` was replaced on active upload and repository ZIP load paths with safe member validation.
- Archive validation rejects absolute paths, traversal, symlinks/special files, excessive member counts, oversized extracted payloads, and suspicious compression ratios.
- CORS defaults are local-origin only and configurable through explicit environment settings.
- REST API now binds `127.0.0.1` by default; public binding requires an explicit `--host 0.0.0.0` operator decision.
- Deployment notes define the auth expectation: FastCode has no built-in user auth, so shared/remote deployments require a proxy or gateway with TLS and authz for mutation endpoints.
- Regression tests cover utility-level malicious archive entries and expansion limits, endpoint-level path traversal uploads, and non-wildcard CORS defaults.

**Remaining follow-up:**
- Add full production deployment examples for a concrete reverse proxy/auth gateway.
- Add API-level zip-bomb tests if upload limits become configurable enough to test without large fixtures.

**Exit criteria:**
- Upload path traversal and zip-bomb regressions are tested.
- Production deployment docs include CORS/auth guidance.

### P0.8 Service-wide state isolation under concurrent traffic

**Status:** Mostly closed for the singleton trusted-local mode. The remaining architectural improvement is request-local immutable artifact handles so read traffic does not serialize behind unrelated mutations.

**Recently landed:**
- Repository load/index, snapshot pipeline, projection build, query/query-stream, multi-repo cache load, delete, cleanup, and shutdown paths now acquire a shared reentrant service lock.
- REST and web load+index/upload+index helpers hold that lock across the entire combined mutation, including scan-cache invalidation.
- Regression coverage verifies the combined helpers use one critical section.
- Regression coverage verifies query serving does not overlap load, index, delete, refresh, or cleanup/unload-style mutations.

**Remaining follow-up:**
- Add endpoint-level concurrency tests for upload vs query with real ASGI request scheduling.
- Longer term, move query serving toward request-local immutable artifact handles so reads do not serialize behind unrelated mutations.

**Exit criteria:**
- Concurrent mutation/query behavior is either serialized by design or explicitly rejected with clear errors.
- No query can observe half-loaded artifacts or deleted repository state.

### P0.9 Release gate and compatibility policy

**Gap:** Smoke tests are green, but stable release gates need a documented contract beyond "current tests pass."

**Required work:**
- Define supported OS/Python/backend matrix.
- Define semantic versioning policy and compatibility promises for snapshots, manifests, and projection artifacts.
- Add release checklist: tests, packaging, install smoke, migration smoke, docs update, changelog.
- Add a minimal benchmark/performance envelope for medium repositories to catch major regressions.
- Separate release gates into explicit tiers:
  - architecture gate
  - package/install gate
  - backend integration gate
  - external-tool gate
  - performance gate
- Define what can block a patch release vs minor release vs major release.
- Define which warnings/errors are acceptable degraded behavior and which invalidate a stable release claim.

**Exit criteria:**
- A maintainer can tag a release by following one checklist with reproducible commands and expected outputs.

### P0.10 Documentation, deployment, and operator runbooks

**Gap:** The codebase has more runtime modes than the docs currently prove safe to install and operate.

**Required work:**
- Write a release-grade install guide for:
  - local single-user mode
  - API/web service mode
  - PostgreSQL-backed mode
  - optional language-tooling/SCIP mode
- Write deployment runbooks covering:
  - required environment variables
  - filesystem expectations for cache/artifact roots
  - startup/shutdown sequencing
  - backup/restore of snapshots, manifests, and projection artifacts
  - log locations and diagnostic collection
- Write operator playbooks for:
  - cache invalidation
  - artifact rebuild after model/tool change
  - database migration/rollback handling
  - lock/fencing incident recovery
  - failed upload/index remediation
- Document trusted-local-only vs production-service assumptions explicitly for the API/web entrypoints.
- Document supported language tiers:
  - stable
  - degraded/structural
  - experimental

**Exit criteria:**
- A new maintainer can install, start, index, query, upgrade, and recover the service using only checked-in docs.
- Public docs do not over-claim support that is only partially tested.

### P0.11 Artifact and migration compatibility policy

**Gap:** Snapshot/manifests/projection/vector artifacts now carry more metadata, but there is not yet a strict compatibility contract for upgrades and invalidation.

**Required work:**
- Version every persisted artifact family explicitly:
  - snapshot metadata
  - manifest records
  - projection artifacts
  - cache payloads
  - vector/index artifacts
- Define upgrade rules for:
  - forward-incompatible schema changes
  - additive metadata fields
  - tool-output schema changes
  - embedding fingerprint changes
  - helper/scip artifact lineage changes
- Add startup validation that detects incompatible artifacts early and reports rebuild requirements clearly.
- Add migration/compatibility tests covering:
  - load old artifact -> accept
  - load old artifact -> rebuild required
  - load incompatible artifact -> explicit hard failure

**Exit criteria:**
- Upgrading versions cannot silently load semantically incompatible artifacts.
- Release notes can state exactly which prior artifacts remain readable and which require rebuild.

### P0.12 Dependency and supply-chain hardening

**Gap:** Stable release needs tighter control over dependency drift and packaging trust than development smoke tests currently prove.

**Required work:**
- Add a dependency review pass for runtime packages with:
  - pinned or constrained high-risk libraries
  - explicit extras boundaries
  - known-native/tooling dependencies documented
- Add security/reproducibility checks:
  - `pip-audit` or equivalent
  - wheel/sdist content verification
  - helper asset inclusion verification
  - lockfile or documented resolver strategy for repeatable installs
- Review subprocess/tool invocation surfaces for:
  - path resolution
  - environment inheritance
  - timeout policy
  - stderr/stdout diagnostics
- Decide which external tools are mandatory, optional, or auto-detected and encode that in install metadata/docs.

**Exit criteria:**
- A stable release can be rebuilt and installed reproducibly from a clean environment with documented dependency expectations.
- Dependency/tooling changes that would alter runtime behavior are visible in release review, not discovered after release.

### P1: Strongly Recommended Before Stable Release

These can be deferred only if the release notes explicitly scope them out.

### P1.1 Deepen semantic fidelity in core helpers

- JavaScript / TypeScript:
  - export alias facts
  - stronger type facts
  - richer interface / implementation facts
- Go:
  - stronger interface implementation facts
  - richer type facts beyond embedded relationships
- Java:
  - stronger type/member binding facts beyond regex/source heuristics

### P1.2 Replace narrow helper heuristics in secondary languages

- Rust
- C#
- Zig
- Fortran
- Julia

These currently emit useful structured facts, but they are still narrower than frontend-native semantic APIs.

### P1.3 Tighten query-time semantic escalation

- Current hook is intentionally conservative and snapshot-scoped.
- Remaining work:
  - use better terminal selection than top retrieved file paths
  - support induced-subgraph upgrades for path queries
  - add ranking tests proving graph-expanded results improve answer context, not only appear in retrieved rows

### P1.4 Repository inventory and parse-cache efficiency

- Unify repository inventory across loader, repo info, indexing, non-git identity, and SCIP language detection.
- Add per-content-hash parse cache keyed by `(rel_path, content_hash, parser_version)`.
- Make loader ignore rules and SCIP visible-file selection share one canonical inventory.
- Add explicit degraded-mode metrics when parse cache is bypassed or invalidated.

### P1.5 Continue store-boundary typing

Typed records now exist for manifests, snapshot refs, snapshot records, index runs, publish tasks, SCIP artifact refs, redo tasks, outbox events, dialogue turns, dialogue sessions, and active projection build/dirty-scope rows.

Still raw-dict-heavy at boundaries:
- API-facing manifest / artifact payload adapters
- snapshot-store and projection-store compatibility payload adapters
- cache/query result payloads
- vector-store search/repo-overview payloads
- pg-retrieval row/result payloads

This item should be treated as the implementation slice of the broader P0.6a schema-flow requirement above, not as isolated cleanup.

### P1.6 Observability and debuggability

- Promote pipeline layer metrics and resolver diagnostics into stable API fields.
- Add structured logs for artifact swaps, semantic escalation, resolver fallback, and lock acquisition/release.
- Add stable cache/update metrics:
  - repository inventory reuse hit/miss
  - parse cache hit/miss
  - embedding cache hit/miss
  - artifact-handle cache hit/miss
  - incremental planner changed-file counts
- Add a documented diagnostic bundle for support: config summary, storage backend, dependency availability, latest run metadata.

### P1.7 Release-fixture and benchmark realism

- Add one or more medium-sized real-world fixtures that exercise:
  - multi-language indexing
  - repeated incremental updates
  - cache reuse after restart
  - query-time snapshot switching
- Record baseline envelopes for:
  - cold full index
  - warm full index
  - one-file incremental update
  - repeated identical query against cached snapshot artifacts
- Track peak memory and artifact size growth, not just wall-clock time.

### P1.8 Runtime dependency optimization audit

**Gap:** Several hot-path dependencies are selected for convenience or compatibility rather than measured runtime efficiency. Stable release should not carry pure-Python bottlenecks in the core path if there is already a viable compiled/runtime-efficient alternative.

**Current audit findings:**
- `networkx` is still used in active graph paths:
  - `ir/graph.py`
  - `ir/merge.py`
  - `graph/build.py`
  - `retrieval/hybrid.py`
  - `mcp/graph_tools.py`
  - `store/snapshot.py`
  - `main/fastcode.py`
- `python-igraph` is already present as a dependency and is only partially used today:
  - `indexing/projection_transform.py` prefers `igraph` and falls back to `networkx`
- this means the project currently pays:
  - dependency weight for both graph stacks
  - Python-object overhead in core graph operations
  - inconsistent graph semantics and conversion cost across modules

**Required work:**
- Benchmark graph-heavy operations under `networkx` vs `igraph` on representative repository snapshots:
  - graph build
  - path/impact analysis
  - community clustering
  - retrieval graph expansion
  - snapshot graph load/save conversion
- Decide the graph contract intentionally:
  - `igraph` as primary runtime graph engine for hot paths
  - `networkx` retained only as compatibility/test adapter if needed
- If `igraph` wins materially, refactor toward one canonical internal graph representation for hot paths and isolate conversions at boundaries.
- Avoid dual-maintenance where one module uses `igraph` and the next immediately converts back to `networkx`.
- Add correctness regression tests proving graph engine substitution preserves:
  - directed/undirected semantics
  - edge attributes
  - multi-edge expectations or explicit non-support
  - path and clustering output invariants

**Exit criteria:**
- The graph engine used in hot paths is chosen by benchmark evidence, not convenience.
- Stable release does not pay repeated conversion overhead between graph libraries on critical query/index flows.

### P1.9 Dependency-level performance hardening

**Gap:** Beyond graph libraries, the runtime stack still includes some heavyweight or slower-than-necessary choices that need measurement and possible narrowing before stable release.

**Audit targets:**
- serialization and API payloads:
  - evaluate whether `orjson` should replace standard JSON on hot API/cache paths
- tabular/dataframe dependency surface:
  - audit `pandas` usage frequency and hot-path necessity; remove or isolate if it is not on the release-critical path
- cache backend behavior:
  - compare `diskcache` local latency against actual workload patterns
  - verify whether Redis is only optional scale-out infrastructure or part of the default performance story
- embedding and vector flow:
  - remove avoidable Python loops around NumPy/FAISS batch operations
  - confirm no per-row conversion churn between Python lists and `ndarray`
- Pydantic boundary cost:
  - keep validation at the shell only; avoid repeated model materialization in internal loops
- text/token prep:
  - audit repeated tokenization/normalization work for cacheable preprocessing

**Required work:**
- Produce a dependency audit table with:
  - dependency
  - active hot-path usage
  - measured cost
  - replacement/isolation candidate
  - decision
- Split dependencies into:
  - core hot-path mandatory
  - optional feature dependency
  - dev/test only
  - compatibility shim pending removal
- Remove or demote dependencies that are not justified by measured production value.
- Add benchmark tests around any substitution that changes runtime behavior or output formatting.

**Exit criteria:**
- The stable dependency set is intentionally minimal for the hot path.
- Performance-sensitive libraries are selected based on measured workload evidence and documented tradeoffs.

### P2: Post-Stable Quality Improvements

- Improve UI polish and workflow around snapshot selection and failure diagnostics.
- Add larger benchmark corpora and performance regression dashboards.
- Expand projection quality tests for architecture summaries and L0/L1/L2 stability.
- Add more real-world repository fixtures for polyglot monorepos.

## Closed Audit Items

### Query-time semantic escalation changing IR graph expansion behavior end to end

**Status:** Test guards added.

**Audit verdict:** PASS after hardening.

**Problem fixed:** Earlier tests verified mechanism (callback called, retrieve count) but not behavior (retrieval results actually change after IR graph expansion).

**Test coverage added** (`fastcode/tests/test_query_handler.py`):
- `test_semantic_escalation_changes_retrieval_results_end_to_end` — verifies answer generator receives expanded second-retrieval results (3 files vs 1)
- `test_semantic_escalation_enables_real_ir_graph_expansion` — uses real `HybridRetriever._expand_with_graph()` and an installed IR call graph to prove escalation changes retrieval behavior
- `test_local_budget_triggers_escalation_for_find_intent` — budget="local" path with find intent
- `test_escalate_query_semantics_returns_skipped_when_snapshot_not_found` — early return when snapshot missing
- `test_escalate_query_semantics_returns_skipped_when_no_target_paths` — early return when no paths extractable
- `test_escalate_query_semantics_returns_degraded_when_warnings_present` — degraded status with resolver warnings
- `test_escalation_does_not_rerun_when_callback_returns_none` — no rerun when callback returns None

### Experimental SCIP warning propagation in full index flow

**Status:** Already covered by existing test.

**Audit verdict:** CONCERNS/borderline PASS (risk score 2/9 — P1×I2)

**Existing test coverage:**
- `test_pipeline_layer2_records_experimental_scip_languages_non_silently` (`test_snapshot_pipeline.py:582`) — comprehensive single-language chain: detection → warning string → `layer2["warnings"]` → `result["warnings"]` + metrics
- `test_experimental_scip_profiles_are_marked_explicitly` (`test_scip_indexers.py:93`) — profile classification guard
- `test_experimental_scip_languages_set` (`test_semantic_resolvers.py:2156`) — canonical set guard

**Minor gaps (low priority):**
- Multi-language warning string (sorted join for Zig+Fortran) untested
- Warning persistence to snapshot store metadata untested

### Helper asset execution from packaged installs

**Status:** Test guards added.

**Audit verdict:** CONCERNS (risk score 6/9 — P2×I3)

**Problem:** `_helper_path()` at `helper_backed.py:248` uses `Path(__file__).with_name(self.helper_filename)`. All 12 existing helper tests bypass this method via patches. Zero tests verify helper assets exist on disk.

**Test coverage added** (`fastcode/tests/test_semantic_resolvers.py`):
- `test_helper_path_returns_existing_file_for_each_resolver` — parametrized across 9 resolvers; asserts `_helper_path().exists()` and correct filename
- `test_helper_command_includes_existing_helper_path` — full chain `_helper_path()` → `_helper_command()` → file exists
- `test_helper_backed_resolver_degrades_gracefully_when_helper_file_missing` — missing asset simulation with `_DummyFallbackResolver`; asserts `structural_fallback` tier and `tool_invocation_failed` diagnostic
- `test_helper_path_co_located_with_resolver_module` — co-location invariant: helper parent directory matches `helper_backed.py` module directory

### Layout merge and root test entrypoint

**Status:** Fixed.

**Audit verdict:** PASS after hardening.

**What changed:**
- workspace-root pytest now has explicit discovery config:
  - `testpaths = ["tests", "fastcode/tests"]`
  - `norecursedirs` excludes `repo_backup/` and other non-project trees
  - root `pythonpath` includes workspace root, `fastcode/src`, and `nanobot`
  - root marker registration covers `edge`, `negative`, `test_double`, `integration`, `e2e`, `regression`, `property`, `benchmark`, and `snapshot`
  - root addopts now mirrors package behavior for schemathesis opt-out
- stale renamed-module test references were updated for the new package layout

**Verified outcome:**
- `uv run pytest -q -rs` from repository root now completes successfully instead of failing during collection on `repo_backup/`

## Rules for updating this file

- Update this file whenever a hardening slice lands.
- Remove completed items from the remaining-work sections or move them into landed status.
- Do not create separate audit/status markdown files unless the user explicitly asks for one.
- When adding a new stable-release claim, also add the matching enforcement test and evidence requirement here.
